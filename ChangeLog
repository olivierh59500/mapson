	* src/cookie.c, src/main.c:
	Added code that will create an MD5 hash over the incoming mail and use
	it has cookie instead of the Message-Id. This saves us from any danger
	when people use weird characters in their message ids, such as "/" or
	":".

	* etc/example_rfctext, etc/example_ruleset: Updated the example files.

	* src/mapson.h, src/escape_from.c, src/main.c, src/Makefile:
	Before a mail is saved to the disk, the string "From " at the
	beginning of a line will now be escaped, to avoid confusing mail
	readers that use this as a seperation mark between several mails.

1997-11-08  Peter Simons  <peter.simons@gmd.de>

	* Released as mapSoN 1.0 beta 2.

	* src/main.c:
	The patterns that check for an RFCmail are now matched only against
	the mail header, instead of the whole mail.

	* src/mapson.h, src/Makefile, src/confirm.c, src/get_user_name.c:
	The "request for confirmation mails" are now sent with "<>" as
	envelope to avoid bounces coming back to us. Not that mapson couldn't
	handle the bounces, it's just that we don't need/want them. Calling
	sendmail with the envelope set requires us to specify a From: line in
	the mail, because sendmail won't add any. Hence we're giving it the
	username to start with. sendmail will append the appropriate domain
	automatically.
