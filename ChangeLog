	* Released 2.0 beta 3.

	* mapSoN will log to $HOME/.mapson/log now rather than via
	syslog(3). This is better because it is a per-user tool and not so
	much a system tool and on many systems the normal user can't even
	read syslog.

	* Added a chapter describing ways to debug mapson to the manual.

	* Released 2.0 beta 2.

	* Added lots of content to the documentation.

	* Compiled-in system paths are available as variables in the
	config file now. See the "config-sample" file or docs.
