	* Released mapSoN 1.0 beta 2.

	* src/main.c:
	The test whether an incoming mail is a request for confirmation or
	a reply to an "rfcmail" of ours is now hardcoded into mapSoN and
	can be removed from the ruleset.

	* src/confirm.c:
	The "request for confirmation mails" are now sent with "<>" as
	envelope to avoid bounces coming back to us. Not that mapson couldn't
	handle the bounces, it's just that we don't need/want them.

	* src/confirm.c:
	Added the special header "X-mapSoN: requesting confirmation" to
 	outgoing "RFCmails",

	* src/is_confirmation.c:
	The search for a mapson-cookie is now carried out case-insensi-
 	tively.
