	* Released 2.0 beta 4.

	* The documentation is almost complete. Two chapters are still
	missing, but you can get along without them. Fixed several typos.

	* Added the "--cookie" command line parameter: If it is specified
	mapSoN does not scan the e-mail but tries to approve that one
	directly. See the chapter about procmail for usage examples.

	* The request-for-confirmation template file may now contain
	environment variables, too.

	* Added the "--accept" parameter to the command line: If it is
	specified, mapSoN will accept the incoming mail unconditionally.
	See the chapter about procmail for usage examples.

	* Improved the sample request-for-confirmation template to be
	user-independent. Users can simply use the installed default now.

	* Released 2.0 beta 3.

	* mapSoN will log to $HOME/.mapson/log now rather than via
	syslog(3). This is better because it is a per-user tool and not so
	much a system tool and on many systems the normal user can't even
	read syslog.

	* Added a chapter describing ways to debug mapson to the manual.

	* Released 2.0 beta 2.

	* Added lots of content to the documentation.

	* Compiled-in system paths are available as variables in the
	config file now. See the "config-sample" file or docs.
