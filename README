Interpreted header fields in the incoming mail:

   "From "              addr-spec
   "From:"              1#mailbox
   "Reply-To:"          1#address
   "Sender:"            mailbox
   "Return-Path:"       route-addr


Header fields I plan to interpret:

   "Message-Id:"        "<" addr-spec ">"
   "References:"        *(phrase / msg-id)
   "In-Reply-To:"       *(phrase / msg-id)


Configuration options:

 o Paths

   string mailbox

        The complete path of the mailbox where mapSoN will store
        accepted mails.

   string config_file

        The path of the mapson config file that contains these
        options. The default is "$HOME/.mapson/config", but that may
        be overriden on the command line.

   string spool_dir

        The path of the spool directory where unaccepted mails wait
        for the arrival of the cookie.

   string address_db

        The path to the address database file. The default is
        "$HOME/.mapson/address-db", but this may be overridden in the
        config file.

   string request_for_confirmation_file

        The path of the mail template to be used to request a
        confirmation cookie. The default is
        "$HOME/.mapson/request-for-confirmation.txt", but this may be
        overridden in the config file.

   string mta

        The path to the mail transport agent to be used to deliver
        e-mail on the system. It is expected that the MTA reads the
        mail on standard input and accepts the address(es) of the
        recipient(s) on the command line. Additional options may be
        specified. The default is "/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t", but this
        may be overridden in the config file.


 o Filtering criterias

   bool strict_rfc_parser

        If this is set to 'true', mapson will ensure that incoming
        mails have a correct "Sender:" header. The rule is as follows:
        If "From:" contains more than one address, a "Sender:" must be
        provided. If set to 'false', mapson will ignore this as long
        as it is able to determine the sender via any of the other
        headers. The default is 'false', but this may be overridden in
        the config file.

   bool let_incorrect_mails_pass

        If this is set to 'false', _any_ syntax error in the mail will
        cause mapson to abort processing with a return code of
        $syntax_error_rc. If set to 'true', mapson will tolerate
        syntax errors as long as it is able to figure out anything it
        needs to know to process the mail. The default is 'true', but
        this may be overridden in the config file.

 o Return codes

   int runtime_error_rc

        This is the return code returned by mapson if any
        runtime-error occurs, such as it not being able to open the
        address database, etc. The default is "75" (temporary
        failure), but this may be overridden in the config file.

   int syntax_error_rc

        This is the return code returned by mapson if processing is
        aborted because of syntax errors in the mail. The default is
        "65" (data format error), but this may be overridden in the
        config file.
