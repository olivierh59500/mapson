                                   mapSoN 3.x

mapSoN should compile on any Unix system with a moderately up-to-date C++
compiler. GNU gcc 3.x or later will work just fine. Just do the usual Autoconf
routine:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mapson
    make all
    make check
    make install-strip

With that part out of the way, go to /usr/local/mapson/etc, rename the file
"sample-config" to "config", and customize to your system. This is a side-wide
configuration file! Users may override all settings by creating a configuration
file of their own in "$HOME/.mapson/config".

Now go to /usr/local/mapson/share and rename the file sample-challenge-template
to challenge-template. Again, you might want to customize it to your preferred
wording, language etc. This is a site-wide file, too. Users can override it by
changing the path in their local configuration file or by creating
"$HOME/.mapson/challenge-template".

Further details on how to configure mapSoN (and how to activate it) can be found
in the user manual at "doc/mapson.html".
