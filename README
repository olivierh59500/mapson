Variables supported in request-for-confirmation template file:

    md5hash             MD5 hash of the original mail
    envelope            Envelope e-mail address
    sender              Sender e-mail address
    return_path         Return-Path e-mail address
    header              The complete mail header

    messageid           Message-id of the incoming mail
    from[]              From e-mail addresses
    replyto[]           Reply-To e-mail addresses

    headerlines[]
        Each entry in this array contains the corresponding header
        line. Please note that a "line" in the header may consist of
        multiple actual text lines because of continuation.

    header[]
        Each entry in this array contains the corresponding text line
        of the mail body -- continuation does not occur here.

    body[]
        Each entry in this array contains the corresponding text line
        of the mail body -- continuation does not occur here.

    Please note that any of headerlines[], header[], and body[]
    contain the trailing linefeed ('\n') of the returned line. This
    may skew your formatting if you're not careful.

Things to do:

    o Re-write address_db to be reusable and to be more efficient.

    o Support headers

       "Message-Id:"        "<" addr-spec ">"
       "References:"        *(phrase / msg-id)
       "In-Reply-To:"       *(phrase / msg-id)

      in strict-parser mode.

    o Don't log with syslog(3); write to a file instead.

    o Include message id in log messages.

    o Convert libmd5 to uint32_t and stdint.h.

    o Add last-used timestamps to each address in the database.

    o Add headers to the mails mapSoN processes and tell the user what
      went on.

    o Read the user's config file and fall back to the global one, if
      the user doesn't have one.

    o Try to create the all directories in the user's home
      automatically.
