Interpreted header fields in the incoming mail:

   "From "              addr-spec
   "From:"              1#mailbox
   "Reply-To:"          1#address
   "Sender:"            mailbox
   "Return-Path:"       route-addr


Header fields I plan to interpret in strict-parser mode:

   "Message-Id:"        "<" addr-spec ">"
   "References:"        *(phrase / msg-id)
   "In-Reply-To:"       *(phrase / msg-id)

Command line arguments:

   -d                   Enable debugging messages.
   -c <file>            Use this config file instead of default.
   [mail [mail ...]]    Gather addresses from files.

    header[]
        Each entry in this array contains the corresponding header
        line. Please note that a "line" in the header may be multiple
        actual text lines because of continuation.

    body[]
        Each entry in this array contains the corresponding text line
        of the mail body -- continuation does not occur here.
