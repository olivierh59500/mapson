* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]



* Noteworthy changes in release 3.2 (2010-02-24) [stable]

  Converted the entire build system to gnulib.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.0 (2004-06-21) [stable]

  The StrictRFCParser option is gone. Didn't do anything useful anyway.

  Added WhiteListDB option. This points to a file containing one regular
  expression per line. Every incoming sender address that matches any of
  those regexes is is accepted and added to the AddressDB as well.

  The cumbersome ReqConfirmTemplate config option has been renamed to
  ChallengeTemplate. Along, the default file name has been renamed from
  reqmail.template to challenge-template.

  Added support for HashCash <http://www.hashcash.org/>. This required adding
  the following config options:

      WhoamiDB          - list of accepted address
      HashCashDB        - path to seen-database
      HashCashExpiry    - expiry time for HashCashes
      HashCashGrace     - grace time to allow for clock skew
      ReqHashCashBits   - required number of collisien bits

  To enable HashCash support, you _must_ create the WhoamiDB file and
  state your e-mail addresses, one per line, so that mapSoN can verify
  the signature in the X-Hashcash header.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.3 (2003-05-27) [stable]

  Added the --dont-scan option to the command line. Specifying this will
  tell mapSoN _not_ to scan the body of the incoming mail for a cookie.
  This is useful in setups, where the cookie is extracted via procmail's
  "+argument" mechanism, for instance, thus it is passed to mapSoN via
  the --cookie flag anyway.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.0 (2002-05-03) [major]

  Added the "--cookie" command line parameter: If it is specified mapSoN
  does not scan the e-mail but tries to approve that one directly.

  The request-for-confirmation template file may now contain environment
  variables, too.

  Added the "--accept" parameter to the command line: If it is
  specified, mapSoN will accept the incoming mail unconditionally.

  Improved the sample request-for-confirmation template to be
  user-independent. Users can simply use the installed default now.

  mapSoN will log to $HOME/.mapson/log now rather than via syslog(3).
