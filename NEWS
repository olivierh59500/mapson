* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

  Updated varexp library to release version 1.2.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.3 (2010-02-24) [stable]

  Converted the entire build system to gnulib.
  Cleaned up the user documentation.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.0 (2004-06-21) [stable]

  The StrictRFCParser option is gone. Didn't do anything useful anyway.

  Added WhiteListDB option. This points to a file containing one regular
  expression per line. Every incoming sender address that matches any of
  those regexes is accepted and added to the AddressDB as well.

  The cumbersome ReqConfirmTemplate config option has been renamed to
  ChallengeTemplate. Along, the default file name has been renamed from
  reqmail.template to challenge-template.

  Added support for HashCash <http://www.hashcash.org/>. This required adding
  the following config options:

      WhoamiDB          - list of accepted address
      HashCashDB        - path to seen-database
      HashCashExpiry    - expiry time for HashCashes
      HashCashGrace     - grace time to allow for clock skew
      ReqHashCashBits   - required number of collisien bits

  To enable HashCash support, you _must_ create the WhoamiDB file and
  state your e-mail addresses, one per line, so that mapSoN can verify
  the signature in the X-Hashcash header.

  If you have a working installation of mapSoN 2.x already, you should perform
  the following steps to upgrade after installing the software:

  - The cumbersome "ReqConfirmTemplate" option in the configuration file has
    been renamed to "ChallengeTemplate". You should edit your configuration
    files accordingly, because mapSoN will abort with an error when finding the
    old keyword.

    Along with this change, the template file has been renamed from
    "reqmail.template" to "challenge-template". Since your existing
    configuration files points to the old name, you don't need to change that
    if you don't want to.

  - The StrictRFCParser option has been removed from mapSoN altogether, so
    you'll have to remove it from your configuration files as well.

  - The following directives have been added to the configuration file:

    WhiteListDB      - one regex per line; matching addresses may always pass
    WhoamiDB         - list of accepted HashCash resources
    HashCashDB       - path to seen-HashCash database
    HashCashExpiry   - expiry time for HashCashes
    HashCashGrace    - grace time to allow for clock skew
    ReqHashCashBits  - required number of collisien bits

    See the installed sample configurations for further hints.

  - To enable HashCash support, all you have to do is to create the file
    pointed to by WhoamiDB. All other settings have defaults.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.3 (2003-05-27) [stable]

  Added the --dont-scan option to the command line. Specifying this will
  tell mapSoN _not_ to scan the body of the incoming mail for a cookie.
  This is useful in setups, where the cookie is extracted via procmail's
  "+argument" mechanism, for instance, thus it is passed to mapSoN via
  the --cookie flag anyway.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.0 (2002-05-03) [major]

  Added the "--cookie" command line parameter: If it is specified mapSoN
  does not scan the e-mail but tries to approve that one directly.

  The request-for-confirmation template file may now contain environment
  variables, too.

  Added the "--accept" parameter to the command line: If it is
  specified, mapSoN will accept the incoming mail unconditionally.

  Improved the sample request-for-confirmation template to be
  user-independent. Users can simply use the installed default now.

  mapSoN will log to $HOME/.mapson/log now rather than via syslog(3).
