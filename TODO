   "Message-Id:"        "<" addr-spec ">"
   "References:"        *(phrase / msg-id)
   "In-Reply-To:"       *(phrase / msg-id)

o Convert libmd5 to uint32_t and stdint.h.

o Make libmd5 get along without __alignof__.

o Add last-used timestamps to each address in the database.

o Add headers to the mails mapSoN processes and tell the user what
  went on.

o Make the gather-addresses mode handle the mailbox format.

o Add an option that tells mapSoN to create missing parent
  directories on the fly, if it wants to write to the spool
  directory or to the address database.

o Add an option that tells mapSoN to let the actual confirmation
  mail pass, too, in case someone writes comments into it.

o Extract the message-id before looking for a cookie so that we have
  it when the success message is logged.

o Add a way to match whole domains, probably even including patters,
  negation, etc.

o Implement my own setenv() because it is missing on Solaris.

o The result of jadetex will swallow "--" in <option> tags and turn it
  into a longer hyphen. This must not be.
