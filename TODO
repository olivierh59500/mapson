o Re-write address_db to be reusable and to be more efficient.

o Support headers

   "Message-Id:"        "<" addr-spec ">"
   "References:"        *(phrase / msg-id)
   "In-Reply-To:"       *(phrase / msg-id)

  in strict-parser mode.

o Convert libmd5 to uint32_t and stdint.h.

o Add last-used timestamps to each address in the database.

o Add headers to the mails mapSoN processes and tell the user what
  went on.

o Make the gather-addresses mode handle the mailbox format.

o Add an option that tells mapSoN to create missing parent
  directories on the fly, if it wants to write to the spool
  directory or to the address database.

o Make another template that does not use columns.

o mapSoN should have options that tell it not to look for cookies
  or to require a cookie in case the mail comes from procmail's
  +argument feature.

o Add an option that tells mapSoN to let the actual confirmation
  mail pass, too, in case someone writes comments into it.

o Extract the message-id before looking for a cookie so that we have
  it when the success message is logged.

o Add a way to match whole domains.

o Implement my own setenv() because it is missing on Solaris.

o The sample config config is installed as $prefix/etc/config-sample;
  there's no way to recognize it belongs to mapson if there's no
  specific prefix! That must not be. Also, mapson does not read the
  global config file at all! Lot's of work to do!

o The documentation of the config file doesn't say where mapson
  expects the config file or anything!

o Add switch that tells mapson to accept the incoming mail in any case
  so that you can redirect user+trust to that address and add the
  senders to the database.

o Change the .template suffix to "-templ".
