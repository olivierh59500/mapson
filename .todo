        FreeBSD doesn't find libgetopt objects.

        The blasted automake tool puts the objects to the
        ptop-level directory, not into the libgetopt
        pdirectory where the sources are, so the compiler
        pwon't find them linking mapson! I either need to
        turn libgetopt into a real library, mess with -L and
        -I flags, or get some fix for automake.

            getopt() and friend reside in the top-level now

        There is getopt.{h,c} in mapSoN and in libhashcash.

        Extract the Message-ID /before/ processing the mail.

        Because right now some log messages don't have a
        message id, so you can't figure out which mail they
        are about.

        Add a way to match MAILER-DAEMON.

        Unfortunately, the address is not valid according to
        RFC2821, so mapSoN will just ignore it. Which means
        that there is no way to let bounces pass unless
        you're using procmail or some other filter.

        This might be useful in case the peer writes

        than just the hash.
