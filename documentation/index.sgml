    <title>System Requirements</title>

    <para>&librfc; has been written for the UNIX operating system and will
(hopefully) compile on any POSIX-compliant system. It has been tested on Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, and MacOS X 10 and built out-of-the-box just fine. Since it
has been written in ISO-C++, it will require a fairly recent compiler, though,
because many older C++ compilers are not ISO C++ compliant. If you're using the
excellent <ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</ulink>, you should
not have any problem. If you do, please <ulink
url="mailto:simons@cryp.to">send me an e-mail</ulink> and I'll see what I
can do.</para>
