confusion, but I made it, and now I have to include it here -- helpful or
not!</para>

    <para>The most current version of the software can be <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=37091">downloaded
from its project page</ulink> at SourceForge.Net -- whom I wish to thank at this
point for kindly hosting this project and for providing a generally excellent
service to the software-development community.</para>

    <para>Apart from downloading the software, you can of course read the user
manual on-line, either in <ulink url="user-manual.html">HTML format</ulink> or
in <ulink url="user-manual.pdf">PDF format</ulink>.</para>

    <title>System Requirements</title>

    <para>&mapson; has been written for the UNIX operating system and will
(hopefully) compile on any POSIX-compliant system. It has been tested on Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, and MacOS X 10 and built out-of-the-box just fine. Since it
has been written in ISO-C++, it will require a fairly recent compiler, though,
because many older C++ compilers are not ISO C++ compliant. If you're using the
excellent <ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</ulink>, you should
not have any problem. If you do, please <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mapson/">file a support request at</ulink>
&mapson;'s project page at project pages at SourceForge.net.</para>
