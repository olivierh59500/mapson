    &purpose;
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Building &librfc;</title>

    <para>The distribution contains <filename>Makefile</filename>s suited for
compilation with the GNU C++ compiler. Be adviced, though, that you will need a
fairly recent version in order to compile &librfc;, because the library makes
use of many features of the ISO C++ standard that are not supported by older
versions of <application>g++</application>.</para>

    <para>Nonetheless, it should be possible to translate &librfc; with other
ISO C++ compilers, too; the library does not use any system specific functions
with the exception of POSIX regular expressions, but these should be widely
available -- at least on Unix platforms. So just take a look at the
<filename>Makefile</filename>s: With only a few modifications you should get
along.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The <filename>test</filename> program</title>

    <para>Included in the distribution is a small test programm,
<filename>test.cc</filename>, which you can compile by executing <command>make
test</command>. When started, this program will read an arbitrary RFC822 address
from standard input, then it will parse the address and print the separate
addresses.</para>

    <para>In addition, the program performs a few parsing operations on
addresses built into the binary.</para>

    <para>The program is not intended to serve any useful purpose, but you might
want to look at the source code to get an impression of how this library may be
used.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Documentation</title>

    <para>The directory <filename>documentation</filename> contains a complete
user's manual for &librfc; -- most notably the files
<filename>user-manual.html</filename> and <filename>user-manual.pdf</filename>.
You should really take a look at them if you plan to use this code. :-)</para>

  <section>
    <title>Getting the latest version</title>

    <para>The latest version of &librfc; is available from
<literal>http://cryp.to/librfc822/</literal>.</para>
