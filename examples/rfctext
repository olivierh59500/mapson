Hi,

a few seconds ago I have received your electronic mail. I notice that
this is the first time you're trying to contact me via e-mail, and I
have a little procedure set up that protects me from unwanted junk
mail. This is why the mapSoN tool has delayed the delivery until it
receives a confirmation from you, by which you certify that you're NOT
sending me any unsolicted commercial stuff.

To confirm this, simply reply to this automatic e-mail and make sure
you include the following line in your reply:

%s

Please include the *full* line and do not edit it, or my tool won't
recognize your confirmation. It is probably best to quote this whole
mail and to send it back.

I am sorry for the extra effort, but unfortunately the amount of junk
mail I receive has made this preparative necessary. My tool keeps
track of who has sent me e-mail before and you won't see this notice
again.

Please note that the mail is processed by an automatic tool. You may
well add personal comments in the reply, it's just that I won't see
them. :-)
